## üöÄ Installation Steps

To get started, follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Node.js and npm  
If you haven't installed them yet, run:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zunxbt/installation/main/node.sh | bash
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Dependencies  
Update your package list and install essential dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip curl screen git yarn
```

Set up **Yarn** for package management:

```bash
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y yarn
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository  
Now, get the project files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zunxbt/rl-swarm.git
cd rl-swarm
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start a Screen Session  
To ensure the node runs in the background:

```bash
screen -S gensyn
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the Node  
Activate a virtual environment and start the node:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
./run_rl_swarm.sh
```

Once the process starts successfully, you should see logs indicating the node is running.
